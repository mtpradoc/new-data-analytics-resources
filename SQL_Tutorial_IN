-- What SQL IN Does
/* This command checks if a particular column value matches anything in the list of values you specify.
Imagine you were a Data Analyst examining medicines sold at CVS Pharmacy.

Suppose you wanted to focus your analysis just on the drugs sold by Biogen, Bayer, and Eli Lilly.

You could use the IN operator to check if the manufacturer name is IN your list of values:
*/

SELECT drug, manufacturer, units_sold
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE manufacturer IN ('Biogen', 'Bayer', 'Eli lilly');

-- This is much more consise than writing out:

SELECT drug, manufacturer, units_sold
FROM pharmacy_Sales
WHERE manufacturer = 'Biogen'
OR manufacturer = 'Bayer'
OR manufacturer = 'Eli Lilly';
