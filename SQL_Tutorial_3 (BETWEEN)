-- WHERE with BETWEEN
/* Suppose a journalist for the Olympics 2024 is writing a "Where Are They Know" article
on golf medalists from the 2000s and is requesting data from the Olympics team.
They could use the following BETWEEN query
*/

SELECT *
FROM medals
WHERE type = "GOLD"
AND year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;

-- other way to achieve the same result, no so elegant

SELECT * 
FROM medals
WHERE type = "GOLD"
AND (year = 2000 OR year = 2004 OR year = 2008);

-- is BETWEEN inclusive?
/* 
In SQL, the BETWEEN operator's range is inclusive. That means both the start and the end values of the range are included!
Imainge you are doing sales analytics and needed to find products whose price is above
$10,000, but no more than $20,000 (inclusive). Here's is what that SQL query would look like
using > and <=
*/

-- Correct Answer
SELECT *
FROM product_sales
WHERE price > 10000
AND price <= 20000;

Incorrect Answer
SELECT *
FROM product_sales
WHERE price BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000;

/* so the diference?
- WEHRE price > 10000 AND 20000 is inclusive which means the total price is more than or equal to $10,000, but less than or equal to $20,000.
- WHERE price BETWEEN 10000 and 20000 is inclusive which means the total price is more than or equal to $10,000, but less than or equal to $20,000.
*/

-- SQL BETWEEN Practice Exercise
/* Use the BETWEEN SQL command to find all data on:
- medicines which sold between 100,000 units and 105,000 units
- AND were manufactured by either Biogen, AbbVie, or Eli Lilly
*/

SELECT *
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE units_sold BETWEEN 100000 AND 105000
AND (manufacturer = 'Biogen' OR manufacturer = "Abbvie" OR manufacturer = "Eli Lilly")
