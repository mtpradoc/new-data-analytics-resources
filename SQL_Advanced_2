-- SQL GROUP BY
/* The SQL aggregate functions like AVG, MIN, and SUM from the previous lesson process an entire
column to come up with an answer. But what if you want to aggregate only part of a table?

For example, instead of finding the average price all Amazon products orders, what if you want to 
find the average spent by category (i.e. average spent on appliances vs. electronics?).

For Excel users, the "pivot table" comes to mind, and the SQL equivalent to that concepts is the 
GROUP BY command which tells the database to separate your data into groups, which can then be 
aggregated indenpendently.

Here's a GROUP BY example that groups Amazon products sales by category:
*/

SELECT
  category,
  SUM(spend)
FROM product_spend
GROUP BY category;

/* Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products
in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each
category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.
*/

-- GROUP BY vs. Excel Pivot Table
/* Both GROUP BY in SQL and Pivot Tables in Excel are tools designed to aggregate and summarized data. To
demonstrate their similarities, let's first create a Pivot table for a data set of FAANG sotcks.

This pivot table finds the average open price for each stock, and the max close price for each stock

You can notice that the 'rows' dialog box in the spreadsheet tool is essentially asking you what column you
want to group by ("ticker"), and the values box is asking you what column values you want to display ("open",
"close"), and how they'll be aggregaed (average, max).

This is the equivalent to the SQL GROUP BY query:
*/

SELECT 
  ticker,
  AVG(open),
  MAX(close)
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
ORDER BY ticker;

-- GROUP BY Two Columns
/* You can GROUP BY two columns, even multiple columns, in SQL. To group by multiple categories, just separate
column names with commas.
For an example of grouping by multiple columns, here's the average stock open price grouped by each ticker
symbol and group by each year:
*/

SELECT
  ticker,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
  ROUND(AVG(open),2) AS avg_open
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker, year
ORDER BY year DESC;

/* And again, just like with ORDER BY syntax for multiple columns, for shorthand, you can use numbers instead
of typing out the full column names, to make your query more concise. 
*/

SELECT
  ticker,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
  ROUND(AVG(open),2) AS avg_open
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY year DESC;

-- GROUP BY Practice Exercise
/* Given FAANG stock prices data, can you write a SQL query which uses GROUP BY to find the lowest price
each stock ever opened at? Order your results by price, in descending order.
*/

SELECT
  ticker,
  MIN(open)
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
ORDER BY MIN(open) DESC;

-- Can GROUP BY be used to remote duplicates?
/* While GROUP BY isn't used for the purpose of finding duplicates, the command does allow you to collapse
multiple rows with the same values into a single row. So, in a way, it could be considered as a way to get rid
of duplicates for certain columns.

Imagine you were visualizing this website traffic data from a Google Analytics report. To get rid of duplicate
browser data, and aggregate this visits information, you could use the following GROUP BY query:
*/

SELECT
  browser,
  visits
FROM google_analytics_data
GROUP BY browser;

-- GROUP BY Practice Exercise #2
/* Suppose you are given a table of Data Science candidates, and their technical skills. How many candidates
posses each of the different skills? Count of candidates form highest to lowest.
*/

SELECT
  skill,
  COUNT(*)
FROM candidates
GROUP BY skill
ORDER BY 2 DESC 1 ASC;

-- What's the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY?
/* Take FAANG stock data, and find the average stock open price for each ticker symbol. Then, ORDER BY the 
average stock open price, from highest to lowest.
*/

SELECT
  ticker,
  AVG(open) AS avg
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
ORDER BY avg DESC;
