-- SQL HAVING
/* Suppose it's not enough to know the aggregated stats for each FAANG stock. Instead, say we wanted to display
just the stocks whose average open price was greater tha $200 per share.

You would think that the WHERE clause would help. You will get hit with the error message "aggregate functions
are not allowed in WHERE".

SELECT ticker, AVG(open)
FROM stock_prices
WHERE AVG(open) > 200
GROUP BY ticker;
!!!! ERROR not allowed in wHERE

HAVING clause can come to rescue! In SQL, HAVING allows you to filter data based on values from aggregate functions.

Here's an example HAVING query that finds all FAANG stocks with an average share open price of more than $200.
*/

SELECT
  ticker,
  AVG(open)
FROM stock_prices
GROUP_BY ticker
HAVING AVG(open) > 200;

-- WHERE vs. HAVING
/* The difference between WHERE vs. HAVING is a common conceptual SQL interview question.
WHERE filters on indiviual rows, versis HAVING filters values aggregated from groups of rows.

WHERE filters values BEFORE Grouping
- Operates on Data From individual rows
- Example: SELECT username, followers FROM instagram_data WHERE followers > 1000;

HAVING filters values AFTER Grouping
- Operates on Data From Aggregated Values from Groups of Rows
- Example: SELECT country FROM instagram_data GROUP BY country HAVING AVG(followers) > 100;
